title: PÃ´le Emploi - Building a user-centered CRM for a government employment agency
intro: _Pole Emploi is a French governmental agency which helps unemployed people
  to find jobs and provides them with financial aid. The agency also advisers companies
  in their recruitment part and helps them to find candidates. In May 2018, we had
  the opportunity at school to work in partnership with this agency. This partnership
  aimed to bring fresh ideas so to help Pole Emploi to improve their workflow with
  companies and job seekers. During this project, I had the chance to work with two
  amazing students,_ [_Lengliang Li_](https://www.behance.net/lilenglian6085 "Lengliang
